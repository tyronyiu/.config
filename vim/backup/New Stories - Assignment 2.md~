The main aim of the book is to address the current global issues and the
disadvantages our future society will face. The book should stimulate
the thoughts of the readers so that they are encouraged to expand their
knowledge in particular range of subjects as well as motivate them to
take future actions. In the beginning of the book, the first objective
helps to understand the positions of the societies as well as the major
incidents that shaped and created the living society nowadays.
Furthermore, the book will illustrate main forces that are responsible
for the driving change based on human activities.

**Rising Capitalism increasing concentration of wealth and power**

The society lives in a progressing environment where continuous change
is a daily matter. Our society is dependent on the progress since the
only value in our life is to reach success and survive materialistically
in the planet. Form the beginning on we are thought that we have to
concentrate on a high education level to achieve a successful career on
a high academic level. However, not everyone has the luck to be born
into a family-owned business or wealthy family and receive the right
education while suffering of a lack of liquidity. Hence, the gap between
the unequal distribution of wealth is consistently increasing, according
to the World Economic Forum, one percent of the world's adult population
owes 46% of the world's wealth whereas around 70% own less than 10K.

But why not stop the inequality within the society. Why is there still a
growing gap between the rich and the poor? The question should be what
can be done against capitalism in its current form. What mean
capitalism, the egoism that only the rich people can have access to
certain resources. Eventually, the society should consider focusing on a
different form, such as a resourced based economic to improve the
current situation of inequality for our future society. This concept is
illustrated by Astro Teller, who considers about utilizing drones for
accessibility to essential resources. Think about purchasing a hammer,
how often are you really in use of it while considering the wasted
resources for the production. Astro Teller states: "If that hammer was
sitting in some central location it could be shared by thousands of
people, really safely, making everybody wealthier functionally because
they would get a hammer when they need it without having to pay the
drain the world's resources''.

If the technological advancement could change the behaviour of utilizing
resources, you really need by moving from an ownership society to n
access society. Obviously, most of the society became too lazy to walk
to a central location to rent a hammer since of the simplicity of
purchasing products by a one-button click. Regarding our future, Amazon
is developing delivery drones who could theoretically fly those rented
hammers or other resources around, which are not necessarily useful.
Promoting drones as a supply chain model would reduce the carbon
footprint by having less transport emission through a flying delivery.
The only barrier our society has to toward will be getting used to it
and see it has a habit because then if we then think back of the fact
that every individual owned a own hammer once, it will sound ridiculous.

Technology in general, will have a huge effect on our global economy and
capitalistic view, as I mentioned in the previous story of the rise of
technology. Through the technological advancement, humans achieved a
wide distribution network all over the world. Companies are adapting to
the dynamic changing economic environment by implementing new
technological developments and making continuously investments. The main
reason of the ever-changing business industry is the fact that companies
are competing with each other while trying to reach a higher market
value. The same economical factor is mirrored in the political section.
The centralisation of wealth and power is for example seen by the US
Presidency. However, the question is if that is a good choice where we
rely our future lives on or should we rethink more fairly conditions in
the political scenes. A solution could be introducing online sections secured
through block chain. Decentralisation of power, governance, policing, lawmaking
and decision making, will regain the equalised distribution of power for
individuals and communities. Astro Teller's concept can be adapted away from the
resource allocation towards the power and responsibility allocation and
distribution.

\@Ty soll ich das weiter ausf√ºhren mit dem politischen System und dem
Change to public sentiment??
