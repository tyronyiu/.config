Good afternoon dear addressee,

This is a report regarding the by Hongtao Zhou owned apartment, 25 Conquest
Tower, 130 Blackfriars Road, SE1 8BZ. Said apartment has been rented out via
*Knight Frank LLP* to *Maximilian Nausch* and *Ty Yiu* for the time span of the
19th August, 2018 to the 19th August 2020. \newline



A broken window categorically falls into part two of Barratt's homeowners'
warranty, as Conquest Tower has solely been completed in construction in 2018.
If it does not even into category one, considering the origin of the cause of
the damage.

> *The 10 year warranty cover comes in two parts, hereâ€™s how it works:*
> 
> **Part 1: 10 year structural warranty.**
> 
> Your new home comes with a 10 year structural warranty, meaning that the cost of
> fixing any damage caused by faults in specified parts of the home, usually the
> structural and weatherproofing elements is covered.
> 
> **Part 2: 2 year fixtures and fittings warranty.**
> 
> During the first two years, you have the added reassurance that if something
> goes wrong within your home, and is covered by the 2 year fixtures and fittings
> warranty, we will make sure it is put right.

Therefore, a broken window, in circumstance not due to external damage is to be
covered by the construction company, in this case *Barratt*. 

















Coming back from the summer, it is sad to say that two windows in our apartment
broke by non-external force.

We assume, that they broke due to temperature differences during the heat wave
not long ago. We left on Monday the 19th of August, but Ty, due to his moving in
undergoing unexpected struggles, required the key to be able to access the flat
and move. He realised that the windows broke and called in an engineer to have a
look regarding the cause.
