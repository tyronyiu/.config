With Adid, it takes less than a few seconds to ex­change con­tact de­tails di­git­ally, this time in­clud­ing so­cial ac­counts.

WHAT IS IT?
------------
Adid is an app to ex­change your con­tact de­tails through a QR code.
After en­ter­ing your de­tails, an Adid con­nect (QR) code is cre­ated which is ready to be scanned by any iPhone nat­ive's / nor­mal cam­era. 

● Con­nect to any people's plat­form ac­count at once! 📲

● Go for the in­nov­at­ive busi­ness card with Adid!

● Share your con­tact de­tails with one tap at the tip of your fin­gers.

● Nev­er type in a wrong num­ber. 📵

HOW TO USE IT?
-----------------
The per­son who scans the code will re­ceive a notif­ication on their screen, prompt­ing them to add a con­tact. After click­ing on it, the con­tact app opens and provides all de­tails which just have to be be saved by a click on the “done” but­ton.

LINK ALL YOUR SO­CIALS IN ONE PLACE - YOUR CON­TACTS
------------------------------------------
So­cial ac­counts are linked, so that when tap­ping on it, like you would tap the phone num­ber to call someone, you are get­ting re­dir­ec­ted to that per­son's re­spect­ive so­cial ac­count, like your in­s­tagram pro­file in the in­s­tagram app. For oth­er so­cial ser­vices like snapchat, when tap­ping, you are be­ing promp­ted to add them to your friend list.
