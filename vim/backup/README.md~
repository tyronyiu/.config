## Requirements

> yabai is officially supported on macOS High Sierra 10.13.6, Mojave 10.14.4-6
> and Catalina 10.15.0. It uses a scripting-addition, which is a bundle of code
> that we inject into Dock.app to elevate our privileges when communicating with
> the WindowServer. The WindowServer is a single point of contact for all
> applications. It is central to the implementation of the GUI frameworks and
> many other services. Because of this, System Integrity Protection must be
> disabled for yabai to function properly.
>
> yabai must be given permission to utilize the Accessibility API, and will
> request access upon launch. The application must be restarted after access has
> been granted. If you are building from source or using the brew --HEAD option,
> it is recommended to first codesign the binary such that access can persist
> through builds/updates. You can read more about codesigning here.
>
> The Mission Control setting displays have separate spaces must be enabled.
