\begin{abstract}
Having known not much about professional sports leagues, organisational
structures or anything remotely connected to traditional sports, this course
extraordinarily increased my knowledgeability in that specific area. 
Mix some biology or chemistry into the material or neurological / psychological
explanations and even a non-jock could get interested in sports management. More
importantly, seeing *sports* as an analogy for *stress situations* or
situations requiring *high performance*, makes the name a little confusing, but
at the same time more relevant to more individuals. 
Luckily for me, that is exactly what the course and instructor did.
