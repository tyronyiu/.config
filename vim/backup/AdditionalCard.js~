A big new feature coming with premium is the upcoming wallet integration. 📲 
You will be able to load your Adid connect-code into the apple wallet and show it directly, 
by double-pressing the Siri-button, like you would show a boarding pass or use apple pay. <br />

Premium will soon include the color and logo customisation of your connect-code,
so that yours doesn't look like everybody else's 😎! <br />

Everybody wants more choice and abilities, so we are working hard on getting that done for you in the form of more fields! 
We Will include more fields like your work-email, linkedIn, website, more social
      accounts, or adress. Also you will very soon be able to include an image
      of yourself! 📸 <br />
