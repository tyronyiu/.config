\textit{"China is a sleeping lion, and when she awakes, the world will
shake"} - \cite{ruddKevin:1}.


Personally, I agree with most of realisms main principles, as well as support
liberalism in politics. 
In my view, china is a very 'sleepy' lion, that would bite if poked,
but would rather mind its own business. American led liberalism may be coming to
a seeming end, though hopefully, it's core values will transcend into the coming
normative world order with a bi- or preferably a multi-polar ruled order,
cascading patterns of liberal principles from system structure down to unit
level.

Many political scientists believe, that modern American liberalism seems to
lose in presence \cite{lse:americanDecline} \cite{lse:americanDecline}. However,
others believe, that American reign will not come to an end in the near future.
The answer is as always, hidden away by time, but extrapolations of behaviours
can be made to reach predictions about likely outcomes \cite{wohlforth:singlePower}.

In the twenty first century no relationship between countries is and will be as
important as the one between the global greatest power, the united states and
china, the world's rising power. Whether they will converge and clash or align
and prosper in a dual control world hegemony, depends upon interpretation of
each other's action and whether or not an anarchistic state of 'self-help'
would be maintained between the two \cite{schwellerRandall:1}.

\section{Declining American liberal hegemony}

The liberal hegemonic U.S. led world order has been recognised to have been
fading in influence, while china's rapid growth and development challenges its
global domination. Whether or not a circumstance of too great friction will
result in conflict or in peaceful coexistence depends upon the choice of
implementation of core values into politics. Differences in interpretation of
the preferred economic system are existent, but less drastic than in how both
powers perceive the other's political views of an aspired global order. Thus, it
can be said, that the current path is on of collision for if one or both powers
don't adapt political views or policies.

The term \textit{'liberalism'} diverges in different parts of the world, due to
the interpretation of the central objective of liberal principles. In Europe,
especially northern countries including the Scandinavians, \textit{liberalism}
is rather associated with a responsibility carried by the government to care for
its nation, thus it's countries' outstanding social welfare systems. Nevertheless
disparities between exact national interpretations of liberalism or intended
implementation, a few integral values are being affirmed, as the principle of
equality, freedom, democratic procedures \& international cooperation. The
integration of these principles is ground of mentioned difference, as even China
is a condoner of liberalism in trade economics and policies
\cite{schwellerRandall:1}.

When comparing the political systems employed by the united states and china
they follow mentioned liberal democracy and authoritarian regime, respectively.
This is also where much of the potential for friction resides, as the 'shadow of
the future' \cite{powell1999shadow} \cite{waltz:structural}.


\section{Clash, Cooperate, Subordinate?}
%=================================

As recently prominently in the news, the ongoing trade war could most
definitively be considered competition or an economic conflict. If not in
accord, the result of past occurrences of competition interpreted by the United
States, is at least a potential threat to its position in the international
community. Thus, the question of whether or not China can be a competitor to the
United States is surely to be agreed with. That induction of thought can be
interpreted from most American foreign affairs political scientists' thoughts on
China \cite{graham:war} \cite{graham:thucydides} \cite{economist:tradewar}.
Besides that, China has always been a country of mystery for the United States.
Who sees China mostly as a potential competitor, sometimes even adversary.
Friction has often existed between the two countries. Ever since Xi Jinping, the
Chinese Communist Party's secretary and de facto leader of the people's republic
of china announced his plan of ‘the great renewal of the Chinese nation’ and
'the Chinese Dream' \cite{xiaoyu:controversialIdentity}, the United States'
interpretation of the future relationship with China withered slightly away
\cite{hamati:values}.

A general consensus among politicians seems to be, that the realist's argument
is one of nations rising and falling in a cyclical recurrence through the
process of political actors balancing each other in an anarchistic environment
referred to as 'balances of power/order' \cite{robinson:cycles}.

Such a process implies the existence of competition and/or conflict between
nations objectified by the concept of self-perseverance, examined by K. Waltz as
'state of self-help'. Both can be easily classified as posing a threat to
another country and inducing fear leading to alterations in behaviour.
As the realists Waltz, Powell and Keohane agree upon, "states’ perennial
uncertainty about their fates presses governments to prefer relative over
absolute gains" \cite{waltz:structural}.

Robert Powell describes three options for a state in a state fearing threat:
"(1) \textit{it can reallocate resources already under its control;} (2)
\textit{it can try to defuse the threat through bargaining and compromise;} (3)
\textit{it can try to draw on the resources of other states by allying with
them}" \cite{powell1999shadow}.

Waltz responses to criticism on his \textit{"Theory of international
politics"} by \textit{Richard K. Ashley} and \textit{John G. Ruggie},
clarifying, that he sees the structure of the global system as defining the
behaviour of its units, while explanations for behaviour stay opaque due to
several levels and thus origins of possible, causes \cite{waltz:reply}.

The behaviour defining structure could be modern American liberalism, democratic
republican right wing liberalism or autocratic socialism or any to be rising
socio-political order, though will be sought to be maintained by the regime
employing the system. Would it be objectified to change behaviour, structural
changes have to be taken to shift the system.

Systems in the state of self-help can be transformed if the system's principles
shift away from anarchistic to a hierarchic form. Therefore, describing the rise
and fall of national powers as a cycle of anarchy and hierarchy, brought arise
by the "shadow of the future" \cite{powell1999shadow} \cite{waltz:structural},
enabling a circumstance of anarchistic self-perseverance in the first place.
Hence, The rise of China and the United States' perception of such as a threat to
its global positioning. Thus it could/should cause the hierarchic system to
become more anarchistic, resulting in the United States lesser prioritising
ideological preferences or maximisation of internal gains.

\begin{quotation}
\textit{"Thucydide's Trap, the dangerous dynamic of rising powers threatening to
    displace ruling power"} \cite{thucydides:1}.
\end{quotation}

When competition arises between falling and rising powers liberals' and
realists' thoughts differ on how states would handle such a situation
\cite{powell:gains}. The liberal institutionalist's argument follows the thought
of 'international institutions serving international interest'
\cite{milward1999european}. Opposing, how \textit{A. Milward} states, that
"realism reveals what liberal institutionalist's 'theory' obscures"
\cite{milward1999european}, that states in circumstances of 'pressure of
competition' \cite{waltzKenneth:2}, act rather in national interest. Furthermore,
\textit{K. Waltz} goes as far as arguing that under such competitive pressures,
the \textit{'self-help'} doctrine for anarchic systems provides legitimisation
for such behaviour. Because, "state behaviour varies more with differences in
power than in differences in ideology or governmental form" \cite{waltz:reply}.


\subsection{Global system structure }
%-----------------------------------
The problem with structure is the inclusion and exclusion of criteria for
defining such. This difficulty increases as relating two nation states of
varying regime systems. The perception of the other, as in how states relate to
another, is what \textit{K. Waltz} is arguing for in \textit{'A response to my
critics'}, especially when considering how totalitarian autocratic and liberal
democratic states relate to each other \cite{waltz:reply}. "Ruggie's belief is,
that structure should contain a logic that accounts for its own transformation
(see Durkheim's dynamic density)" \cite{waltz:reply}pp.328, and implies thus the
difficulty of keeping these levels of units separate. 

The global system doesn't expect the strong nations to ally, effectively
increasing their power over others, and not having balances form, but rather
creating, not a unipolar, but a few-led world hegemony. Rather, these states
would ally with the 'weaker' unit in the system, because of the relative threat
wedge between 'strength' in the system \cite{axelrod2009evolution}. After all, it
is self-perseverance, the maintenance of position in the system, that drives
nations in the, through a realism's prism viewed, global system. "Whether
political actors balance each other or climb on the bandwagon depends on the
system's structure" \cite{waltz:p126Neo}. Realism provides is still majorly seen
as the defining theory for international politics \cite{waltzKenneth:2}.

\begin{quotation}
Every time peace breaks out, people pop up to proclaim that realism is dead.
    That is another way of saying that international politics has been
    transformed. The world, however, has not been transformed; the structure of
    international politics has simply been remade" \cite{waltz:structural},
    pp.39.
\end{quotation}

In a self-help system states only seek profit and power after assurance of
survival. Similarly to Maslow's 'theorem of hierarchical needs'
\cite{maslow:motivation}. Thus, states won't allocate as much effort and
resources to promoting its own prosperity and maximisation of gain, but rather
employ measures of sustaining and maintaining its position in the global system.
These disparities within global positioning of units could thus result in
containment methods and those of protectionism.

American modern liberalism is not the same anymore under Trump than under the
Obama or Reagan administration and foreign policies are wildly different. In a
recently held debate between John Mearsheimer and Xuetong Yan "His personal
belief and way of conduct might be inherently contradictory to the U.S.'
overarching foreign policy principles" \cite{xuetongYan:1}. Mearsheimer said,
that "it is very hard to categorise him (trump) as following any particular
theory" \cite{mearsheimerJohnInt:1}. Thus, it seems like a change in structure
of system and thus behaviour, giving explanation to differences in former and
current handling of China, including foreign policy. The question arises
naturally, to what structure will Trump's impact form the American system and
thus impact on the global community. 

In circumstances of employment of self-help strategies, as is the case with the
united states and china currently, this could result in utilising such
disproportionate gain to implement policies to intentionally damage or hinder
the other. A good example of such would be the ongoing trade war between the two
nations \cite{economist:tradewar}. Imposing, chasing and increasing tariffs on
imported goods. Notably, that national security suspicions of Chinese networking
electronics parts being used in U.S.  infrastructure, and other reasons have
toughened the situation. One of which is the fact, that the effect of Chinese
import tariffs impacts Trump's voter base area the most
\cite{economist:tradewar}.

Also, the issue regarding China's foul play in technological intellectual
property or having a trade surplus with the United States has to be disregarded.
Assuming, that those issues were squared away and the situation less security
related, the possibility of mutual benefit returns to the table.
This though will pose the question of, "when faced with the possibility of
cooperating for mutual gain, states that feel insecure must ask how the gain
will be divided. They are compelled to ask not 'Will both of us gain?', but 'Who
will gain more?'" \cite{waltz:anarchy} pp.101.

Considering, that the shadow of the future will hinder a 'blue-sky' outlook, the
United States would continue seeing China as a prospect for threat or
competition and thus conflict. They have always done so, ever since founded, the
Americans have wondered whether their reign will soon be of counted days or
pivot to its downfall. 

When in fact, "Robert Axelrod and Robert Keohane believe that World War I might
have been averted if certain states had been able to see how long the future’s
shadow" \cite{waltz:structural}.

Kenneth Waltz describes it well, stating, that "the contours of the future’s
shadow look different in hierarchic and anarchic systems. The shadow may
facilitate cooperation in the former; it works against it in the latter"
\cite{waltzKenneth:2} \cite{waltz:reply}.

As also been discussed, but can be commonly seen, it is the case, that 
"while liberal societies may not war with one another, liberals are quite
aggressive towards their non-liberal opponents" \cite{doyleMichael:1}.

Furthermore to liberals being more assertive on non-liberal regimes, Robert
Gilpin argues, that


\begin{quote}
liberals and Marxists cannot easily accept the doctrine of intellectual peaceful
    coexistence \cite{gilpinRobert:1}.
\end{quote} 


On the other hand, China's opinion of American led administration is undesirable
and not consequent. American involvement in Chinese internal affairs have been
recorded multiple times \cite{Lampton:americaChina}. Most (Americans) advocate the
involvement in China \cite{warren:americaChina}, and China obviously doesn't
like that. The American involvement is central point of collision for China,
trade war here or there, direct political involvement is different. Not only
different for China, but also for the United States' typical regime's behaviour.
As Robert Tucker describes, the Americans haven't only been lately been engaging
in involvement in other countries, but also outside of their by themselves set rules. 
This again indicates the anarchistic / hierarchic cycle in system structure as a
origin of behaviour changes, caused by fear of potential threats.


\begin{quotation}
"According to a senior official, the Reagan administration 'debated whether we
    had the right to dictate the form of another country’s government. The
    bottom line was yes, that some rights are more fundamental than the right of
    nations to non-intervention... We don’t have the right to subvert a
    democracy but we do have the right against an undemocratic one"
    \cite{tuckerRobert:1}.
\end{quotation}


Considering that the United States would disregard their policies and values in
the face of self-help, it underlines the thought, that it is unlikely for the
United States to simply have a bipartisan superpower order. Similarly, exactly
these kinds of fear induced self-interest, rule abandoning behaviour is what
China cannot compromise to be led by. 

Furthermore, China can probably continue as it does and slowly diminish American
influence, as subordinating to a American led order odes not seem like a viable
option for China at all, especially considering the CPC's recently announced
plans on global positioning. Although, firmly assuring, that there should be
"nothing to fear" \cite{scmp:1}. Their calmness disregarding the trade war,
makes it seem as though the Chinese are in for the long term. Planning further
ahead than the Americans and not engaging in self-help measures too much, is
indicating a shadow of the future, further away. Nevertheless China's actual
plans, as opaque their 'transparent' government is in comparison to multilateral
institutionalism, someone's verbal assurance has never been grounds to trust on
the political stage.

Very importantly to note here is, the difference between American globalisation
and Chinese's perception of globalisation. The Chinese subvention system is
heavily criticised but part of their globalisation strategy, formed by their
autocratic, planned economy approach. The amount of state operations is greater
than in the United States and it could be argued for a legitimacy for and
against.

The only real outlook for no conflict seems thereby to be, that the United
States changes its perception of China as a non-threat, which won't be the case.
Hence, as the behaviour is seemingly unchangeable, even under a already
different American system structure held together by Trump, the system needs to
be restructured. Though, remembering, that "It does not break the essential
continuity of international politics" \cite{waltz:structural}, pp.39.

William Wohlforth argues that any development must occur, it will be probably be
longer rather than shorter in time. "Theory cannot say when 'tomorrow' will come
because international political theory deals with the pressures of structure on
states and not with how states will respond to the pressures"
\cite{wohlforthWilliam:1}.

\subsection{Re-structuring the global order}

"Robert Axelrod has shown that the 'tit-for-tat' tactic, and no other, maximizes
collective gain over time" \cite{waltz:structural}. Which plays well into
Trump's handbook and the ambitions the Chinese have regarding trade and
political strategy in general.

The "U.S. paid to be the western hemisphere hegemon. For china, the best
possible solution would be to become the eastern hemisphere regional hegemon"
\cite{mearsheimerJohnInt:1}. Therefore alleviating itself to a bipartisan
hegemonic world order with the United States.

Thus, "states could combine their efforts cheerfully and work to maximize
collective gain without worrying about how each might fare in comparison to
others" \cite{keohane1986neorealism}. 

Particular and bilateral partnerships need to be formed, this is harder where
the countries' political and economic assumptions differ. Multilateral
international institutionalism's integration into the world's systems seems
central to a hierarchic structure, for which is longed for. Chinese and
Americans have to compromise and find a middle ground on political issues, as
their deeply intertwined economies and economic similarities hold them together.

\section{Conclusion}

After careful consideration, the conclusion arose, that the rise of China cannot
be managed within the existing American led world order and must result in
competition and conflict. Either or both states have to adapt their political
system structure to accommodate compromises with the other. 

The fear of the 'shadow of the future' and the following shift from hierarchy to
anarchy, caused by in self-helping, intended rules disregarding states,
is the origin of power balancing and suppression. 

The constant changes in the fabric of systematic structure lets powers rise and
fall, though under the assumption of 'self-help'. Ever since the cold war, the
global hierarchy has been American led, though said hierarchy seems to crumble
and tumble into anarchy. Though, rivaling it is the rise of China, caused by the
disproportionate allocation of gains and resources, by the United States
themselves. Integration into the WTO, outsourcing manufacturing and waste
disposable in massive magnitudes, America is the driving cause of Chinese rise. 

China will not subordinate to American rule and neither the other way around.
Hence, for the better of both and all, a middle ground shall be reached to
disengage a fear loaded situation.
